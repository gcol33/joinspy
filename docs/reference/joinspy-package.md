# joinspy: Diagnostic Tools for Data Frame Joins

Provides diagnostic tools for understanding and debugging data frame
joins. Analyzes key columns before joining to detect duplicates,
mismatches, encoding issues, and other common problems. Explains
unexpected row count changes and provides safe join wrappers with
cardinality enforcement. Concepts and diagnostics build on tidy data
principles as described in 'Wickham' (2014)
